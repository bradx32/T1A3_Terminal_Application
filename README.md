# T1A3_Terminal_Application
### Aquarium Water Testing Application

## Documentation Requirements

### R1. Answers to all the documentation requirements below
### R2. README.md has a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings
### R3. Provide full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable)
- Colored Package - dslackw. “Colored: Simple Library for Color and Formatting to Terminal.” PyPI, https://pypi.org/project/colored/

- Rich package - McGugan, Will. “Rich: Render Rich Text, Tables, Progress Bars, Syntax Highlighting, Markdown and More to the Terminal.” PyPI, https://pypi.org/project/rich/

### R4. Provide a link to your source control repository
- Link to T1A3 Terminal Application: https://github.com/bradx32/T1A3_Terminal_Application


### R5. Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.
- Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.


### R6. Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:

- at least THREE features

- describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .


### R7. Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 


> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

### R8. Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

## Code Requirements

### R9. Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:

- variables and variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- write and utilise simple functions

- error handling

- input and output

- importing a Python package

- using functions from a Python package


### R10. Apply DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

### R11. Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

### R12. Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

### R13. Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:

- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes

- pushing all commits to a remote repository

### R14. Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:

For example,

- writing a script which turns the application into an executable
